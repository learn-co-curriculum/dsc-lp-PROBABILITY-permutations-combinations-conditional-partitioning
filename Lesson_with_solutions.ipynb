    "\n",
    "Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Onion is the same as  Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Onion and Onion, Mushrooms, Pepperoni.\n",

    "From this permutation-esque conceptualization, we need to divide by how many different arrangements could be made with any the three toppings, as these will be the repeat examples under our current formulation.\n",

    "    > *'cancel'* is a common terminology and so used here, but potentially misleading and vague. If you wish to be clarify, albeit verbosely, we can say that matching factors in the numerator and denominator *'cancel'*, because they form a multiplicative identity.
